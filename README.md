## Installation

**Hubble UI** is installed as part of **Hubble**. Please see the [Hubble | Getting Started Guide](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/hubble/) for details.

## Motivation

Troubleshooting connectivity in microservices-based applications is a challenging task. Simply viewing a list of all pods (`kubectl get pods`) does not indicate dependencies between each service, external APIs, or databases.

Hubble UI enables effortless, automatic discovery of the service dependency graph for Kubernetes Clusters at L3/L4 and even L7, allowing user-friendly visualization and filtering of dataflows as a Service Map.

See the [Hubble Introduction](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/hubble_intro/) for more information.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) â‰¥ v18.0

### Backend

To develop and make changes to the Go backend:

1. Go to the `backend` directory and execute the `ctl.sh` script:

   ```sh
   cd ./backend
   ./ctl.sh run
   ```

$~~~~~~~$ Wait until the build is complete and the server is running.

2. In another terminal, create a port-forward toÂ `hubble-relay`:

   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward -n kube-system deployment/hubble-relay 50051:4245
   ```

**Docker ðŸ—³**

If you prefer to develop with Docker, build the backend Docker image to run the backend:

```sh
make hubble-ui-backend
```

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run watch
   ```

3. Open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)**.

**Docker ðŸ—³**

If you prefer to develop with Docker, build the frontend Docker image:

```sh
make hubble-ui
```
